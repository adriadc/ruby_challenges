Lost mey PSQL
ERROR: psql: FATAL: database “<user>” does not exist

to be exact psql: FATAL: database “adriadc” does not exist

My guess is that the bundall install knocked out my Psql configuration.
Also was not helped when I opened the active record zip gile before running bundle install
The sys tem was up to date with xcode, homebrew and gems

used this command to get back in my database
psql -d template1

t appears that your package manager failed to create the database named $user for you. The reason that

psql -d template1
works for you is that template1 is a database created by postgres itself, and is present on all installations. You are apparently able to log in to template1, so you must have some rights assigned to you by the database. Try this at a shell prompt:

createdb
and then see if you can log in again with

psql -h localhost
This will simply create a database for your login user, which I think is what you are looking for. If createdb fails, then you don't have enough rights to make your own database, and you will have to figure out how to fix the homebrew package.

SOLUTION: what fixed it

go back to prompt and type

createdb -h localhost

my db came back

From Stock overflow: In my case i wrote $ createdb -h localhost to solve the error could not connect to database postgres: could not connect to server. After that i may connect to postgresql console via psql -h localhost.
