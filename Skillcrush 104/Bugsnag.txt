Bugsnag Notifier for Ruby
The Bugsnag Notifier for Ruby gives you instant notification of exceptions thrown from your Rails, Sinatra, Rack or plain Ruby app. Any uncaught exceptions will trigger a notification to be sent to your Bugsnag project.

Bugsnag captures errors in real-time from your web, mobile and desktop applications, helping you to understand and resolve them as fast as possible. Create a free account to start capturing exceptions from your applications.
How to Install

Add the bugsnag gem to your Gemfile

gem "bugsnag"
Install the gem

bundle install
Configure the Bugsnag module with your API key.

Rails: Use our generator

rails generate bugsnag YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
Other Ruby/Rack/Sinatra apps: Put this snippet in your initialization.

Bugsnag.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
end
The Bugsnag module will read the BUGSNAG_API_KEY environment variable if you do not configure one automatically.

Rack/Sinatra apps only: Activate the Bugsnag Rack middleware

use Bugsnag::Rack
Sinatra: Note that raise_errors must be enabled. If you are using custom error handlers, then you will need to notify Bugsnag explicitly:

error 500 do
  Bugsnag.auto_notify($!)
  erb :"errors/500"
end
