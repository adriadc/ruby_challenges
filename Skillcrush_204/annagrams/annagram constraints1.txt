#annagram constraints
#1. we don’t care if the input word or the output words are actually words 
#2. arguments to the method will be an array of strings (meaning we are going to pass our 
#methods an array for now, like [“a”, “b”, “c”]).
#3. imit the number of letters in the input word, starting with limiting it to 1 letter, then 2, and 3.

#annagram with one letter
get letter[a,b,c]
print letter[a,b,c]

#anagram with 2 letters
get letters[ab,bc,cd]
move one letter to the right
print letter[ab,bc,cd]
