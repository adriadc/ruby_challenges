To delete an element at a particular index:

arr.delete_at(2) #=> 4
arr #=> [2, 3, 5]

To delete a particular element anywhere in an array, use delete:

arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]
arr.delete(2) #=> 2
arr #=> [1,3]

In the last form, an array of the given size is created. Each element in this array is created by passing the elementâ€™s index to the given block and storing the return value.

Array.new(3){ |index| index ** 2 }
# => [0, 1, 4]
