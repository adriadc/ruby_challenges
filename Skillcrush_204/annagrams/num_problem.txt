Hey Adria,

I'm glad that you're learning things :) 

okay so I presume you tried to create a new person with your form (since line 15 in your PeopleController is inside of the post method), and I also presume (correct me if my assumptions are wrong) that you tried to create a person with an empty birthdate?

Now take a good look at your method and think about what happens, step by step (line by line) if 
your params[:birthdate] is empty
params[:birthdate] = '12-12-1960'
params[:birthdate] = '12121995'

Hint: The error message you're seeing is telling you that the argument that you're passing into the method strptime is not a valid date:


I hope this helps :)
-Max

birthdate = Date.strptime(params[:birthdate], "%m%d%Y")
