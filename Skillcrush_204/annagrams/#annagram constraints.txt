anagram constraints
1. we don’t care if the input word or the output words are actually words 
2. arguments to the method will be an array of strings (meaning we are going to pass our 
methods an array for now, like [“a”, “b”, “c”]).
3. limit the number of letters in the input word, starting with limiting it to 1 letter, then 2, and 3.

annagram with one letter
get letter[a,b,c]
print letter[a,b,c]

anagram with 2 letters
get letters[ab,bc,cd]
move one letter to the right
print letter[ab,bc,cd]

anagram with 3 letters
Loop - while do
get letters[abc,bcd,cde]
print letters[abc,bcd,cde]
move one letter to the right
Compare with initial array
if the array different then continue process
else
print letters[ab,bc,cd]
end
end
